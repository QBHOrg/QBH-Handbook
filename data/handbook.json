After two or more years, heroin use among MAT consumers declines, on average, to 15% of pre-treatment levels.

Criminal activities related to heroin use resulted in social costs that were four times higher than the cost of methadone maintenance treatment (Harwood et al., as cited in NIDA, 1995, 1-47). In addition, for every dollar spent on methadone maintenance treatment, there is a savings to the community of between $4-$13 (results of CALDATA study, as Stoller and Bigelow, 1999, 24)."

The chemical compounds that act on reward pathways in the brain can be taken into the body by various routes. Because of their water-solubility and lipid-solubility, alcohol and other drugs are rapidly distributed to virtually every tissue in the body, and can be detected in these tissues for hours to even days after drug use.  The term ‘drug testing’ is used as a general term for such testing of urine or other body fluids or tissues. The presence of alcohol, nicotine, other drugs, or their metabolites in a consumer’s body fluids or tissues can provide evidence of substance use; but it must be emphasized that evidence of substance use alone is insufficient to substantiate that a case of addiction is present, and similarly insufficient to substantiate that any functional impairment related to substance use is present.  Drug testing is also an important screening and diagnostic procedure in the assessment of psychiatric conditions, in which aberrant behavior, perceptions, thought processes, or affective states could be attributable to either a primary psychiatric condition or to the effects of a psychoactive substance."

Although police officers are generally supportive, QBH strives to correct any misconceptions police personnel have about MAT programs. Consumers are to be differentiated from people actively using illicit drugs or abusing prescription drugs, and law enforcement personnel are informed about MAT program operations, with the understanding that police and the program share a purpose—addressing substance abuse in the community. Other community problems (e.g., drug sales, unsafe community conditions) identified during staff tours will be reported to law enforcement authorities. Local officers are encouraged to contact the MAT program about problems involving consumers, but in a fashion that protects consumer confidentiality."

Other reasons may be inadequate provider training or screening, an overlap of symptoms, or that other health issues need to be addressed first.

The focus is on progress markers and behavioral improvements as guideposts, and avoids terms such as “success” and “failure.” Even small improvements may be significant. For example, an outcome evaluation might measure drug use (as quantified by drug testing) in consumers who have spent various times in treatment. Such a study can set a baseline and provide a benchmark to evaluate the effects of changes in program practices, for example, prescribing individually appropriate dosages for consumers. Possible measures to assess MAT treatment outcomes might include drug use, criminal activity, medical problems, vocational skills, employment, family relationships, and social activities. The measures selected by our MAT programs should agree with the target behaviors specified in program goals and objectives. For example, evaluation of a treatment initiative designed to reduce substance use, decrease criminal involvement, and increase job skills should be based on data in those areas. The programs can also measure other outcomes (such as consumers' use of emergency rooms for medical care) to assess whether it has had other effects on consumer behaviors or the community."

Reception and other support staff is expected to be accepting and understanding of consumers from diverse groups because these staff members often are the first people a new consumer sees at the program and those with whom the consumer interacts most. When possible, QBH recruits staff that reflects consumer demographics and will also consider hiring people who are recovering from addiction.  It is generally recognized that when program staff generally reflects the demographics of the population served, consumers are more likely to feel comfortable in the program."

Studies have shown that MAT program staff with negative or punitive attitudes is associated with lower rates of consumer retention and poorer consumer outcomes. QBH program supervisors are instructed to be vigilant about monitoring staff attitudes and to provide training to create or sustain appropriate attitudes about consumers and MAT."

Treatment staff members, who might have absorbed society's antipathy toward people in MAT, sometimes use counter-therapeutic language, for example, the phrase “dirty urine” to describe an unsatisfactory urine drug test (“positive test” is less judgmental). Staff is instructed to avoid terms suggesting the criminal justice system, such as “probation” or “probationary,” to refer to the status of consumers doing poorly in treatment. “Termination” should be avoided in reference to consumer discharge. Other preferred expressions in MAT include “consumers” not “clients” and “dose tapering” or “medically supervised withdrawal” not “detox” in reference to withdrawal from treatment medication. Applying words derived from “toxin” to treatment medication suggests that the medication is a toxin; “detoxification” should refer only to withdrawal from substances of abuse."

Ask the consumer to stand up. Observe in profile. Observe all body areas again, including hips. (Comment: Be sure to look at the consumer from the front, sides, and back.

The formal procedure for using the AIMS will be:  Ask the consumer if there is anything in his/her mouth (i.e., gum,\ncandy, etc.), and if there is, ask him/her to remove it. (Comment: In the less formal procedure, you only need to ask about anything in the mouth if you see abnormal mouth movements.)  Ask the consumer about the condition of his/her teeth. Ask the consumer if s/he wears dentures. Are the consumer's teeth or dentures bothering him/her? (At times it is prudent to look into the consumer's mouth with a bright light.)  Ask the consumer whether s/he has noticed any movements around the mouth, face, hands, or feet. If \"yes,\" ask the consumer to describe them and to what extent they bother him/her or interfere with his/her activities. (Comment: Besides asking about choreiform and choreoathetoid movements, this is a good time to ask about akathisia. Ask the consumer if s/he feels the need to move his/her feet or other parts of the body. Ask the consumer if s/he feels jittery, anxious, restless, or like jumping out of his/her skin. Ask the consumer if his/her mind feels fuzzy or if s/he is having difficulty focusing [cognitive akathisia]. Questions relating to akathisia probably should be asked much more frequently than the formal AIMS is usually performed.)  Have the consumer sit on a chair with the hands on his/her knees, legs slightly apart, and feet flat on the floor. Look at the entire body for movements while in this position. (Comment: this is a good time to look at respiratory movements; be sure to look for diaphragm movements. When the consumer talks, note any laryngeal or pharyngeal dyskinesia.)  Ask the consumer, with hands hanging unsupported and between his legs, if male, or, if female and wearing a dress, hands hanging over, but not touching, her knees. Observe hands and other body areas. (Comment: The point here is to keep the hands and fingers unsupported.)  Ask the consumer to open his/her mouth. Observe the tongue at rest within the mouth. Do this twice.  Ask the consumer to protrude his/her tongue from mouth (\"stick your tongue out\"). Observe abnormalities of tongue movement. Do this twice. (Comment: Can the consumer keep his/her tongue protruding outside the mouth? If the consumer forgets to keep the tongue out, it is likely to be related to inattention. If the tongue goes in and out of the mouth, the movements might be choreoathetoid and related to tardive dyskinesia.)  Ask the consumer to tap his/her thumb to each finger on the same hand sequentially, as rapidly as possible, for 10-15 seconds. Do this separately with the right hand, then with the left hand. Observe facial and leg movements. (Comment: This is the first activation movement.  On activation only score choreiform and choreoathetoid movements. Do not score normal appearing movements of the opposite side of the body or tongue protrusion, if it is not accompanied by choreic movements. Such movements are usually \"overflow\" movements and may be normal or part of another neurological condition. Watch the consumer's legs for restlessness [e.g., shaking the leg from the knee]. Do not score restlessness as dyskinesia; it may be related to anxiety or akathisia."
